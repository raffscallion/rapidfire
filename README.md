Smoke exposure modeling

rapidfire provides relatively accurate particulate information derived from information retrieved easily. This package includes tools for acquiring input data, developing regression models, and using those models to predict surface level PM2.5 concentrations, especially during wildfire smoke episodes. It harvests official air quality monitoring, satellite observations, meteorological modeling, operational predictive smoke modeling, and low-cost sensor networks. Data are fused using random forests regression.
